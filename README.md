## Formulas used to count:
Formulae for calculating a BMI is : BMI = (Weight in KG)/((Height in Meter)*(Height in meter))

Converting Height from feet to meter : in Meter = (Height/3.281)

E.g- Age: 25, Height: 5 foot and Weight: 50KG

 in meter= 5/3.281 i.e. 1.5239
Then the Output:  BMI = (50KG/(1.5239*1.5239)) i.e 21.5 and according to the index it falls under good shape category.
